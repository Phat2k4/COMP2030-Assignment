- nort0191 and call0186: they did not do eveything.
### Note:
- we agreed to get a markdown in individual because We have many problems that we cannot control such as someone dropping out of class, not completing assignments, and differences in opinion. So we will come up with a plan where each person will be responsible for the work that has been divided.
