## User Research Report
1.	Research Methods

To empathize with the target audience for **Flinders Uni Skill Share (FUSS)**, several methods were used such as observational studies (Government Digital Service, n.d.), interviews/surveys, and case studies (Nielsen & Loranger, n.d.):

- **Observation studies**: understand some ways that students are finding supportations  
  - **Action**: Where do students come if they have a problem? Can someone help them?  
  - **Example**: Library, Discords, Forum, Clubs, and AI  

- **Interviews & Surveys**: empathize with boundaries that inhibit students, through short talks with common questions to find problems that need solving.  
  - **Stakeholders**: Professors, Recruiters, Students  
  - **Thematic coding for Interview**:  
    - What is the biggest problem during learning skills of students?  
    - What skills are required in job applicants?  
    - How can I help you?  

- **Case studies**: some old problems that were solved could be helpful for new ones.  
  - **Execution**: select 4–5 students’ journeys in one semester who have the same topics, schedule, and background (undergraduate/graduate).

3. Competitor Analysis  

- **LinkedIn Learning**  
  - **Strengths**: High-quality environment, many professional courses, well-structured certificates, supports career development.  
  - **Weaknesses**: Requires payment for professional content, low interactivity, focuses mainly on professional skills.  

- **Discord / WhatsApp Groups**  
  - **Strengths**: Free and easy to access, supports text/image/file sharing, real-time interactive communication, easy group formation.  
  - **Weaknesses**: Unstructured content, chaotic discussions.
