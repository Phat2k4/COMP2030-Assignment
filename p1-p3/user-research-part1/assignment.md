## User Research Report
1.	Research Methods
To empathies the target audience for Flinders Uni Skill Share (FUSS). There are some methods were used such as observational studies (Government Digital Service, n.d.), interviews/surveys, and case studies (nielsen & Loranger, n.d.):
•	Observation studies: understand some ways that students are finding suportations 
o	Action: Where do students come if they have problem? Whether can someone help them?
